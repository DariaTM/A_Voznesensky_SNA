Social Network Analysis

The project was implemented as part of the course "Social Networks Analysis" (HSE, May 2024, best project of 2023-2024 SNA cource)


**SNA PROJECT**

*Social network graph of non-graphomaniac poet A.Voznesensky*

**The goal of the project:** Social Network analysis of AV contacts structure and identification of the most influential people.

**Why it is worth doing:** this will help to understand which professional and social groups AV interacted with and will help identify implicit connections between his contacts, determine the circle of individuals to whom he dedicated his works and whom he mentioned in them.

**Who did something similar before:**

**How to reach the goal?**
To achieve the goal, I will construct a graph for all the contacts mentioned in the biography and autobiography of AV, and I will create a ranking of the significance of these individuals in the literary community for the list of poets and writers in his circle.

**Dataset required to do the project:**
To implement the project, it is necessary to create Ð° dataset, with a planned number of contacts ranging from 300 to 500 individuals, specifying the type of relationship (acquaintance, friendship, romance, correspondence, meeting) and indicating social affiliation (poet, writer, politician, musician, etc.). The challenge in forming this dataset is associated with the possible lack of information about the acquaintance of contacts AB with each other.

**Anticipated SNA Methods**
Building a model of social network evolution
Clustering, community detection
Model training and Interpretation

**Hypothesis**
The scientific hypothesis is to assume that AV used all the significant contacts in his social circle. To test this version, we need to build an AV dating timeline.
